## Analysis of Big Ideas Lab Survey Data

This file is to document the analysis process for the Big Ideas Lab survey data. 

First I will load the necessary packages for analysis.

```{r install, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

```

Then I will load the dataset to be analyzed. 

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
big_ideas_data <- read_excel()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
