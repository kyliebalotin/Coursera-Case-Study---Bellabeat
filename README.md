# Coursera-Case-Study---Bellabeat
This repository will contain information about how I approached the Bellabeat Case Study for Coursera Google Data Analytics Certificate. 

## Purpose 
In this case study, I was asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products in order to see how consumers use smart devices. The results of this study would be presented to the company's executive team and used to guide the company's marketing strategies.

## Data
The case study provided one dataset to use for this project: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). The FitBit data contains fitness tracker data from 30 users. This data has a few limitations including:
- Lack of demographic data such as sex/gender, which makes it difficult to assess whether the sample set could reflect the Bellabeat consumer population. According to the case study documentation, Bellabeat makes health-focused products for women. Without demographic data, it's possible that the sample set's results could not be completely reflective of Bellabeat's consumers.
- Outdated data, which may also make it difficult to assess whether current consumer trends match consumer activity collected in 2016.
- Small sample size. 30 participants may not be a large enough sample to reflect the larger population.
